# ITV Technical Task

A simple simulation of supermarket checkout capable of applying promotions to any given basket of items either through console or with a CSV file.  
  
Note: The main priority was to make it simple and extensible with the right design patterns. As per the requirements only core Java (11) is used and Spring framework is not used.
